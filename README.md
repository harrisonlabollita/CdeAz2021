# Introduction to Density Functional Theory
A repository exploring the basic ideas of density functional theory (DFT) using the recently developed code [DFTK.jl](https://juliamolsim.github.io/DFTK.jl/stable/)!

Topics covered:


- building blocks
- Examples


The purpose of this repo is the idea for a potential summer school for high school students to get them excited about physics, computational physics, material science, and [Julia](https://julialang.org)!
