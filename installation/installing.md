## Installation Guide
Welcome to Clubes de Ciencia Arizona 2021! We are so excited to be working with you this week. We have a lot of things planned but before we get started we need to setup a few things on our computer. We will need to install a _package manager_ called [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) and the [Julia](https://julialang.org) programming language. These will be the two major tools that we will be learning how to use throughout the week. Below we have outlined how to install both of these essential tools for the week's course!

### 1. Installing Anaconda
The [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) documentation is very through to help install this software on Windows, macOS, and Linux. We've provided the basic steps below, but if you run into any trouble please click on the link.

#### on Windows
1. Start by downloading the Anaconda executable which is available [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows)
2. Open the file you've just downloaded. This should be in your Downloads folder.
3. A Windows Installer should now be active. Follow the instructions.
4. When you are reach the "Choose Install Location" prompt, choose the default path that it provides. No need to change this.
5. Once you have successfully installed the software you will see the message, **"Thanks for installing Anaconda"**

You should now find **Anaconda Navigator** and **Anaconda prompt** in your applications.

#### on macOS
1. Start by downloading the Anaconda executable which is available [here](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads#macos)
2. Open the file you've just downloaded. This should be in your Downloads folder.
3. A macOS Installer should now be active. Follow the instructions.
4. When you are reach the "Choose Install Location" prompt, choose the default path that it provides. No need to change this.
5. Once you have successfully installed the software you will see the message, **"Thanks for installing Anaconda"**

### 2. Installing Julia
We will now install the Julia programming language. This will be our main tool for the week that we will be using. Firstly, here's a link to the [documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/). You will want to keep this handy throughout the week for looking up various syntax commands.

Start by downloading the current Julia release available [at this page](https://julialang.org/downloads/). Please choose which ever format matches your system. For Windows, you will want to choose the _installer_ version (either 64-bit or 32-bit).

Once you've successfully installed the language, you will find a Julia icon in your applications folder. Go ahead and launch this application so that we can install the last piece of the possible that we will use for this week.

### 3. [DFTK.jl](https://juliamolsim.github.io/DFTK.jl/stable/)
Now we will install the electronic structure code that we will be using for the week. This will be very easy to do! The steps are the following:
1. Launch Julia
2. type ']'
3. type 'add DFTK'
4. Julia will take care of the rest!
