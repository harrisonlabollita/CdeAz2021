# Day 2
*Objectives*: Establish main ideas that we would like to reference to for the remainder of the week.

*Details*:

 - Morning:
      - An interactive presentation illustrating the concepts that we will need for the rest of the week. Topics include: atoms and crystal structure, electronic interactions, Schrodinger equation, and why the problem is so hard. (~ 1 hour 30 minutes)
 - Afternoon:
      - Learn how to build the crystal structure that we will need for the week. Basis vectors, atomic positions. (~ 30 minutes)
      - Write a short program that can optimize the positions of the atoms for us. (~ 1 hour)
