# Day 3
*Objectives*: Learn the basics of band theory and what certain features tell us about how a material will behave electronically, go over standard inputs for DFT calculations, complete a couple of DFT calculations using the DFTK.jl software library.

*Details*:

 - Morning:
      - Review/complete yesterdayâ€™s workshop. (~ 15 minutes)
      - Discuss basics of band theory. Metal versus insulator. Identify key features in density of states and band structures that scientists look for when classifying the behavior of a material ( ~ 45 minutes)
      - Standard inputs for DFT calculation (crystal structure, grid point mesh, etc.) (~ 30 minutes)
 - Afternoon:
      - Using DFTK.jl, perform canonical calculations for a metallic and insulating material. Crystal structures will be provided. This will be our first time using the code. (~ 1 hour 30 minutes)
