# Day 4
*Objectives*: graphene project!

*Details*:

 - Morning:
      - Using our optimized graphene structure, we will compute the density of states and band structure. We will analyze the results by plotting and summarizing specific data. (~ 1 hour 30 minutes)
 - Afternoon:
      - Mention possible next steps. Bilayer structure with twisting, etc. (~ 30 minutes)
      - Start the clubâ€™s final presentation. (~ 1 hour)

## Project Description 
During this week, we will study the electronic structure of [graphene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene). Graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice. The 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov for their groundbreaking experiments in the realization of single layer graphene ([interestingly enough Scotch tape was involved](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=graphen+nobel+prize&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8).

Graphene is a remarkably simple material with rich physics that is still being explored today. In our workshop, we will start by building the crystal structure of graphene. With the crystal structure, we will optimize the lattice constant by writing a simple optimization program. We will then analyze the electronic structure of graphene, reproducing many key results. Students will complete their own electronic structure calculation for graphene using DFTK.jl. They will then extract meaningful data from this calculation, e.g. band structures and density of states. We will then discuss the meaning of these results and potential next steps that the student can build upon from our initial analysis.
