# Graphene!

Today, we will complete the graphene project! See the [project description](../README.md) for more details. This directory contains the master script to perform the calculation, save the calculation, and then plot the results with the script [run.jl][run.jl].

For the interested, take a peak into the advanced directory. There we perform magnetic calculations and investigate the effects of twisting bilayer graphene!
